Perfect 👍 you’ve already seen the classic beginner ones (sum, Fibonacci, palindrome, etc.).
Here’s another batch of basic–medium level coding problems often asked for freshers in interviews/online rounds:

🔹 More Beginner-Friendly Problems

Print the factors of a number
👉 Input: n=12 → Output: 1 2 3 4 6 12

Find GCD (HCF) and LCM of two numbers
👉 Input: 12, 18 → Output: GCD=6, LCM=36

Check if a number is perfect (sum of its divisors excluding itself = number)
👉 Input: 28 → Output: Perfect Number

Check if a number is strong (sum of factorial of digits = number)
👉 Input: 145 → Output: Strong Number

Print prime numbers between 1 and N
👉 Input: n=20 → Output: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

Print the reverse of a string
👉 Input: "hello" → Output: "olleh"

Count vowels and consonants in a string
👉 Input: "hello" → Output: Vowels=2, Consonants=3

Check if a string is palindrome
👉 Input: "madam" → Output: Yes

Find ASCII value of a character
👉 Input: 'A' → Output: 65

Swap case in a string (uppercase → lowercase and vice versa)
👉 Input: "HeLLo" → Output: "hEllO"

🔹 Slightly Trickier (Still Freshers’ Level)

Find the missing number in a sequence
👉 Input: [1,2,3,5] → Output: 4

Find duplicate elements in an array
👉 Input: [1,2,3,2,4,1] → Output: 1, 2

Check if two strings are anagrams
👉 Input: "listen", "silent" → Output: Yes

Count words in a sentence
👉 Input: "I love coding" → Output: 3

Reverse each word in a sentence
👉 Input: "I love coding" → Output: "I evol gnidoc"
